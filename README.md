# System Programming Projects

Welcome to the System Programming Projects repository. This repository contains a comprehensive collection of projects and tasks aimed at providing hands-on experience with system-level programming concepts. These exercises are tailored to help you understand and implement low-level programming techniques, operating system interfaces, and system calls.

## Contents

- **File I/O**: Demonstrations of file operations including reading, writing, and manipulating files using system calls.
- **Process Management**: Examples covering process creation, termination, and inter-process communication (IPC) through pipes, shared memory, and message queues.
- **Threading**: Implementation of multithreading, synchronization mechanisms, and thread communication using pthreads.
- **Memory Management**: Exercises on dynamic memory allocation, memory mapping, and understanding memory hierarchy.
- **Network Programming**: Basics of socket programming, client-server models, and network communication protocols.
- **Signal Handling**: Techniques for handling signals in Unix-like systems, writing signal handlers, and signal-driven I/O.
- **Device Drivers**: Introduction to writing simple device drivers and interfacing with hardware.
- **Shell Scripting**: Writing shell scripts to automate tasks and manage system resources.

## Objectives

- To acquire practical knowledge of system-level programming and operating system interfaces.
- To understand and implement various system calls and their applications.
- To develop efficient and robust system programs that interact seamlessly with the underlying hardware and operating system.
