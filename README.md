# System Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and tasks related to system programming. These exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts, operating system interfaces, and system calls.

## Contents

- **File I/O**: Programs demonstrating file operations such as reading, writing, and manipulating files using system calls.
- **Process Management**: Examples of process creation, termination, and inter-process communication (IPC) including pipes, shared memory, and message queues.
- **Threading**: Implementing multithreading, synchronization mechanisms, and thread communication using pthreads.
- **Memory Management**: Exercises on dynamic memory allocation, memory mapping, and understanding memory hierarchy.
- **Network Programming**: Basics of socket programming, client-server models, and network communication protocols.
- **Signal Handling**: Handling signals in Unix-like systems, writing signal handlers, and signal-driven I/O.
- **Device Drivers**: Introduction to writing simple device drivers and interfacing with hardware.
- **Shell Scripting**: Writing shell scripts to automate tasks and manage system resources.

## Objectives

To gain practical knowledge of system-level programming and operating system interfaces. To understand and implement various system calls and their applications. To develop efficient and robust system programs that interact with the underlying hardware and OS.
